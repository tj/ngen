       Enter your email: tj@vision-media.ca
       Project description: awesome foo-ness

structure:
 
     ./History.md
     ./Readme.md
     ./index.js
     ./lib/<project>.js
     ./test/<project>.test.js
     ./support
     ./Makefile
     ./package.json

## NPM Templates

 It is possible to install additional templates by using npm. You can install community templates or create your own by adding them to your local npm registry.

 After installing the template, you can use the -n or --npm flag to specify the npm package as a template. As a convention, the npm packages should be named with ngen-npm_package for example, a connect based template would be named ngen-connect.

 If you would like to start making your own templates and sharing them with the community you can check out [ngen-basicexample](https://github.com/demetriusj/ngen-basicexample) for additional help on making a template.
